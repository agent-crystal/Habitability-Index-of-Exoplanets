# Habitability-Index-of-Exoplanets
 - plots a scatter-plot with distance on the y-axis and habitability index on the x-axis of planets from the NASA exoplanet archive
 - formula used is referred from [The Astrophysical Journal](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0004-637X/814/2/91#apj521048s2)
 - a planet is considered to be habitable if it is
                                               * terresitial
                                               + flux is between 60 and 350 according to [HITE guide](https://vplapps.astro.washington.edu/vpltools/hite/HITETutorial.pdf)

# Issues Faced
- difficult to calculate albedo; used an estimate instead
